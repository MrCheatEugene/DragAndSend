# DragAndSend
File is too large, but you want to send it to your freind RIGHT NOW? Drag the file to DragAndSend shortcut/batch file and in moments you will get a temp link for your file.

# Made simple, works the best.

With DragAndSend you will forget a limit of 300MB in Skype, 8MB in Discord and so on.

The process is simple - get dropped file name, and then upload it to https://transfer.sh(awesome guys, go check them out!), then get the returned URL to file and paste it into clipboard.

And also, it's fully on batch.

# Windows only
Sorry, but right now this software is windows-only. I will write a Java version someday, but not right now.
